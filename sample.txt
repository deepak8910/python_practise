I love my country, and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage.
In their well being and prosperity alone lies my happiness
I shall give my parents, teachers and all elders respect and treat everyone with courtesy.
I shall always strive to be worthy of it.
India is my country.
All Indians are my brothers and sisters.
To my country and my people, I pledge my devotion.
